        <h2>About Me</h2><br>
        <p1>My aim is to become a Full stack developer. The programming languages which I prefer to make my projects are HTML/CSS and Javascript.Coding seems fun to me as I never get bored of writing many lines of the program until I get the contentment when I am finally done writing a program that serves the right purpose. There might be many things which I am yet to learn for becomming a Full stack developer but I do the best I can to get better at it as my career path unfolds. As a student of Third Year in field of Commerce, programming is the one that grabbed my attention. Other than programming I love to play Video games, Cricket and Football. I love to spend time reading books which eventually motivates me to have bigger ambitions, believe and simultaneously work for my goals and achieve success in it.</p1>
